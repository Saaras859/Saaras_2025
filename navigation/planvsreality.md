# My Journey with Blog Design and Wikipedia Integration

- Initially, I planned to create a **beautifully designed blog** with **animations** and **eye-catching visuals**.
- Quickly realized that I didn’t have the **necessary skills** or **time** to bring that vision to life.
- Decided to **simplify** the process by **modifying** the **Jekyll** layout slightly.
- Chose to go with the **Cayman theme** for its clean, minimalist look.
- Made a few small adjustments to the **layout**, which ended up looking **good enough**.

## Gemini and Wikipedia Integration Idea

- I wanted to integrate **Gemini** to enhance the functionality of a **Wikipedia page**.
- The idea was to use Gemini to **parse** Wikipedia pages and **fact-check** based on its training data.
- Unfortunately, I struggled to figure out how to make it work effectively and couldn’t get the integration right.

## The Projectile Simulation Attempt

- I also wanted to create a **projectile simulation** to demonstrate dynamic physics in action.
- However, my pre-existing code was **static** and couldn’t be **updated** in real-time to simulate changes.
- I realized that the code needed to be **rewritten** or **restructured** to allow for **continuous updates**, but I couldn’t commit the time to doing that.
