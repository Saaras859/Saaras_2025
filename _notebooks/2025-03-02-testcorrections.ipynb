    "## Question 1: Dice Roll Simulation\n",
    "**Problem:** Simulating the sum of two dice rolls with a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Code Snippet:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int sum = /* missing code */;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** E) `2 + (int) (Math.random() * 6) + (int) (Math.random() * 6)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Each die has 6 sides (1-6)\n",
    "- `Math.random()` returns a double in range [0, 1)\n",
    "- Multiplying by 6 gives [0, 6)\n",
    "- Casting to int gives {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "- Adding 1 to each would give values 1-6, but since we're adding 2 at the beginning, this effectively adds 1 to each die roll\n",
    "- Therefore, this formula correctly simulates rolling two dice and summing their values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect Option C:** `(int) (Math.random() * 6) + (int) (Math.random() * 6)`\n",
    "This produces values from 0-10 (two values from 0-5), not 2-12 as required for two dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: Class and Interface Relationships\n",
    "**Problem:** Evaluating valid class instantiations based on inheritance and interface implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Structure:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface Student { /* implementation not shown */ }\n",
    "public class Athlete { /* implementation not shown */ }\n",
    "public class TennisPlayer extends Athlete implements Student { /* implementation not shown */ }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** D) `Student d = new Athlete();`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- This is INVALID because `Athlete` does not implement the `Student` interface\n",
    "- A variable of type `Student` can only reference objects of classes that implement the `Student` interface\n",
    "- `Athlete` does not implement `Student` (only `TennisPlayer` does)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Options Analysis:**\n",
    "- A) `Student a = new TennisPlayer();` - Valid: `TennisPlayer` implements `Student`\n",
    "- B) `TennisPlayer b = new TennisPlayer();` - Valid: Direct instantiation\n",
    "- C) `Athlete c = new TennisPlayer();` - Valid: `TennisPlayer` extends `Athlete`\n",
    "- E) `Athlete e = new Athlete();` - Valid: Direct instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3: Method Execution Analysis\n",
    "**Problem:** Determining array values after executing the `mystery(3)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Code:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private int[] numbers;\n",
    "\n",
    "public void mystery(int x) {\n",
    "    for (int k = 1; k < numbers.length; k = k + x) {\n",
    "        numbers[k] = numbers[k - 1] + x;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Initial values: {17, 34, 21, 42, 15, 69, 48, 25, 39}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** A) `{17, 20, 21, 42, 45, 69, 48, 51, 39}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- With `x = 3`, the loop iterates through indices 1, 4, and 7\n",
    "- For k=1: `numbers[1] = numbers[0] + 3 = 17 + 3 = 20`\n",
    "- For k=4: `numbers[4] = numbers[3] + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45`\n",
    "- For k=7: `numbers[7] = numbers[6] + 3 = 48 + 3 = 51`\n",
    "- Final array: `{17, 20, 21, 42, 45, 69, 48, 51, 39}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect Option C:** `{17, 37, 21, 42, 18, 69, 48, 28, 39}`\n",
    "This would be the result if the code segment was changed to `numbers[k] = numbers[k] + 3;` instead of `numbers[k] = numbers[k-1] + x;`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4: Method Logic Error\n",
    "**Problem:** Identifying the error in the `biggest` method which is supposed to return the greatest of three integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int biggest(int a, int b, int c) {\n",
    "    if ((a > b) && (a > c)) {\n",
    "        return a;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else if ((b > a) && (b > c)) {\n",
    "        return b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        return c;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C) `biggest may not work correctly when a and b have equal values.`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- If a = b > c, the method will return c incorrectly\n",
    "- The first condition checks if a > b, which fails when a = b\n",
    "- The second condition checks if b > a, which also fails when a = b\n",
    "- This leads to returning c even when c is smaller than both a and b\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect Answer B:** `biggest may not work correctly when c has the greatest value.`\n",
    "- When c is the greatest value, both conditions will fail correctly and c will be returned\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Implementation:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int biggest(int a, int b, int c) {\n",
    "    if (a >= b && a >= c) {\n",
    "        return a;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else if (b >= a && b >= c) {\n",
    "        return b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        return c;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5: Array Analysis Method\n",
    "**Problem:** Understanding what the `mystery` method returns when analyzing an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int mystery(int[] arr) {\n",
    "    int index = 0;\n",
    "    int count = 0;\n",
    "    int m = 0;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for (int outer = 0; outer < arr.length; outer++) {\n",
    "        count = 0;\n",
    "        for (int inner = outer + 1; inner < arr.length; inner++) {\n",
    "            if (arr[outer] == arr[inner]) {\n",
    "                count++;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        if (count > m) {\n",
    "            index = outer;\n",
    "            m = count;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return index;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** E) `An index of a value that occurs most often in nums`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The method uses nested loops to count occurrences of each element\n",
    "- For each element at position `outer`, it counts how many times it appears in the rest of the array\n",
    "- It keeps track of the element that has the most occurrences and its index\n",
    "- The method returns the index of the element with the highest frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect Answer D:** `A value that occurs most often in nums`\n",
    "- The method returns the index of the most frequent value, not the value itself\n",
    "- If we wanted the most frequent value, we would return `arr[index]` instead of `index`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6: Insertion Sort Algorithm\n",
    "**Problem:** Analyzing a partial insertion sort implementation and determining array values after execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Initial array: {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}\n",
    "for (int j = 1; j < arr.length; j++) {\n",
    "    int insertItem = arr[j];\n",
    "    int k = j - 1;\n",
    "    while (k >= 0 && insertItem < arr[k]) {\n",
    "        arr[k + 1] = arr[k];\n",
    "        k--;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    arr[k + 1] = insertItem;\n",
    "}\n",
    "// What are the values after two passes?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** C) `{3, 4, 5, 2, 1}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- In insertion sort, after 2 passes, the first 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2) will be sorted\n",
    "- Starting with `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`\n",
    "- First pass (j=1): Compare 4 with 5, swap, get `{4, 5, 3, 2, 1}`\n",
    "- Second pass (j=2): Compare 3 with 5, then 3 with 4, shift, get `{3, 4, 5, 2, 1}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect Answer D:** `{3, 5, 2, 1, 1}`\n",
    "- This is not a valid result of insertion sort on this array\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 7: String Processing Method\n",
    "**Problem:** Determining the correct replacement for missing expressions in a method that processes strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public String wordsWithCommas() {\n",
    "    String result = \"\";\n",
    "    int sizeOfList = /* expression */ ;\n",
    "    for (int k = 0; k < sizeOfList; k++) {\n",
    "        result = result + listOfWords.get(k);\n",
    "        if (/* condition */) {\n",
    "            result = result + \", \";\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    result = result + \"!\";\n",
    "    return result;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer:** D) `/* expression */ : listOfWords.size()` and `/* condition */ : k < sizeOfList - 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The method needs to build a string from a list of words, separated by commas\n",
    "- `listOfWords.size()` correctly gives the number of elements in the list\n",
    "- The condition `k < sizeOfList - 1` ensures a comma is added after every word except the last one\n",
    "- For example, with words {\"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\"}, this produces \"One, Two, Three!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect Answer B:** `/* expression */ : listOfWords.size()` and `/* condition */ : k > 0`\n",
    "- This would incorrectly add commas after every word except the first one\n",
    "- The result would be \"One, Two, Three,\" (incorrect comma after the last word)\n",
    "- The correct approach adds commas between words, not after every word except the first"
