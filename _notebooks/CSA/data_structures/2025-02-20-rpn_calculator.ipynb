    "title: Calculator Enactment \n",
    "description: In mathematics, an expression or mathematical expression is a finite combination of symbols that is well-formed according to rules, like PEMDAS. In computers, expression can be hard to calculate with precedence rules and user input errors to handle computer math we often convert strings into a notation like rpn to solve the problem. \n",

    "## Hack\n",
    "Review this code for key data structures.  You will be required to enact a Calculator in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the guidelines...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enactment starts with Original Expression, turns into Tokenized Expression, then to RPN, and finishes with Final Result.\n",
    "2. Appoint a Caller(s).  A caller is a person who prompts the figures (tokens) through the steps of the calculations.  There could be a person that is the overall Caller and others that coordinate entrance and exits into Queues or Stacks.\n",
    "3. Create two to three Calculation expressions, one simple and one interesting.  Assign people to be a Token, aka TermOrOperator.  They will need to move through steps of calculation and into Queues or Stacks.\n",
    "4. On Calculation, you will need to simulate the compression of two to three TermOrOperator becoming a single TermOrOperator.  This process will continue until you obtain a result.\n",
    "5. Do not rush through this, you will be judged for clarity and accuracy on representing alogorithm.  It would be best if you simulated all the steps, as the main System.out.println shows it.\n",
    "6. To be a TermOrOperator, there are phone apps that make big numbers or symbols.   You could change your representation on phone after a calculation, making your phone calculate to intermediate step.\n",
    "7. Forming teams in class of 9-10 would be best, three teams per class.  Work it out.  You have a class and a half, finals will be in Office Hours.\n",
    "8. Step through code in debugger, this will help you visualize.  Code is in [Hacks](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio/tree/master/src/main/java/com/nighthawk/spring_portfolio/hacks/calculator) in Spring Portfolio.\n",
    "9. There will be a write-up and capture that needs to be a part of this assignment and blog."
