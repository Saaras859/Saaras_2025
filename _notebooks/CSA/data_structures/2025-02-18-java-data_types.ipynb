    "## Data Types in Java\n",
    "Before discussing ***Data Structures***, it is important to review ***Data Types*** and the AP ***Methods and Control Structures*** topic. To begin this discussion, I asked ChatGPT, ***\"what are Java data types\"*** and was really happy with the answer ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, ***data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold***. Here are the main categories of data in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primitive data types** are stored directly in memory.\n",
    "    - byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)\n",
    "    - short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)\n",
    "    - int: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)\n",
    "    - long: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)\n",
    "    - float: 32-bit floating-point number (1.4e-45 to 3.4e+38)\n",
    "    - double: 64-bit floating-point number (4.9e-324 to 1.8e+308)\n",
    "    - boolean: true or false\n",
    "    - char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference data types** are stored as a reference to a memory location where the actual data is stored.\n",
    "    - Objects: instances of classes\n",
    "    - Arrays: a collection of data of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrapper classes** provide a way to use primitive data types as objects. They \"wrap\" the primitive data types into an object.\n",
    "    - Byte: represents a byte value\n",
    "    - Short: represents a short value\n",
    "    - Integer: represents an int value\n",
    "    - Long: represents a long value\n",
    "    - Float: represents a float value\n",
    "    - Double: represents a double value\n",
    "    - Boolean: represents a boolean value\n",
    "    - Character: represents a char value\n",
    "\n",
    "### More on Wrapper Classes\n",
    "A class always wraps data types and methods.\n",

    "***Wrapper classes are often used when working with collections*** or other APIs that require objects rather than primitive data types. They also provide methods for converting between primitive data types and their corresponding object types, as well as methods for performing operations on the wrapped values.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ***assign a value*** to a wrapper class object, Java automatically ***creates a new instance*** of the wrapper class and assigns the value to it. This process is called ***Auto-boxing***. For example, to assign an integer value to an Integer object:\n",

    "In Java, **reference data types are data types that hold references or memory addresses that point to objects**. These data types do not actually contain the data they refer to, but instead, store a reference to the memory location where the data is stored. The area in blue is called the stack, where variables local to the method are stored; the area in green is called the heap, used to store objects.\n",

    "Key things to remember on Data Types and Memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference data types are used to store complex data structures** such as objects and arrays. Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior, while arrays are collections of data of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When a reference data type variable is declared, memory is used for the reference variable itself**, but not for the object or array it refers to. Memory for the object is allocated separately using the \"new\" keyword. The reference variable is assigned to point to the memory address of the object(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference data types are passed by reference**, which means that when a reference variable is passed as a method argument, the method receives a copy of the reference, but both the original reference and the copy point to the same object in memory. This allows methods to modify the object or array that the reference points to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primitive data types are stored directly in memory and are passed by value**, which means that when a primitive data type variable is passed as a method argument, the method receives a copy of the value, not a reference to the original variable. This also means that modifying the value of a primitive data type variable inside a method does not affect the original value of the variable outside the method.\n"
