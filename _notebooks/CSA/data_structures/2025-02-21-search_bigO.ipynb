    "## HashMap\n",
    "> Below is an example using a HashMap and listed are some key things to consider when using this data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hashing: HashMap uses a hash function to map keys to their corresponding buckets. The hash function is used to compute the index of the array where the key-value pair should be stored. A good hash function should generate a unique hash code for each key, but collisions (i.e., two keys with the same hash code) can still occur.  Hash map in Java does not maintain insertion order either by key or by the order inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance: HashMap provides constant-time performance (O(1)) for get() and put() operations, as long as the hash function is well-distributed and there are no hash collisions. However, in the worst case, the performance of a HashMap can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key and value types: HashMap allows any non-null object as a key, and any object (including null) as a value. However, to use a class as a key, it must implement the equals() and hashCode() methods. HashMap uses the equals() method to check if two keys are equal, and the hashCode() method to generate the hash code for the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Iteration: HashMap provides several ways to iterate over the key-value pairs in the map, including using keySet(), values(), and entrySet(). The entrySet() method returns a Set view of the key-value pairs in the map, which can be used to iterate over the pairs and modify the map as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Thread safety: HashMap is not thread-safe, which means that if multiple threads access the same HashMap instance concurrently and at least one thread modifies the map structurally, the behavior is undefined. To make a HashMap thread-safe, you can use the ConcurrentHashMap class instead, which provides concurrent access and is designed for high concurrency. In a Full Stack project it would be best to use a NoSQL database to avoid concurrency issues."
