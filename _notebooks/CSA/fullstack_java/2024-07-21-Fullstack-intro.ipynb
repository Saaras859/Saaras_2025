    "## Introduction\n",
    "> What is Full Stack?\n",
    "- A full stack feature in software development refers to a feature or functionality that spans both the **front end** (client side) and the **back end** (server side) of an application. \n",
    "- This means that the feature includes everything from the **user interface** and user experience (what the user sees and interacts with) to the **server**, **database**, and **logic** that make the feature work behind the scenes.\n",
    "- The components or stack of this feature are usually as follows\n",
    "1. **Frontend**, the part that the user interacts with\n",
    "2. **Backend**, the sever side of the feature, handling requests, interactions with the database\n",
    "3. **Database**, Where the apps data is stored and managed\n",
    "4. **API**, The Application Programming Interface allows the fronted to connect and communicate with backend\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framework\n",
    "- When creating the backend and frontend of your project you should have a clear answer to these two questions\n",
    "1. What **data** will need to be stored for my feature to work, and what **endpoints** are needed for my feature?\n",
    "2. What will the **wireframe** for my feature look like, and how will it be **auto-generated**?\n",
    "- The questions above are what make your feature unique, no matter the feature there will always be a certain partition of the code that is the exact same\n",
    "- If you're able to answer these questions above you will have no problem in seeing the vision of your feature\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to answer the questions with your idea\n",
    "- In these documents im going to be creating a announcement API, so I will be creating that when I talk about my own feature\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Question #1\n",
    "- For a announcement, I'm going to need an **ID** (standard in every database), **author**, **title**, **body**, **time**, and **tags** data\n",
    "- For the endpoints think about how this data need's to be accessed besides the usual CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) methods, maybe a **fetch** by **author** or **tag**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Question #2\n",
    "- **Search** for similar wireframes online on what to base your feature off of, maybe similar to how tweets look\n",
    "- It will be auto generated by generating each announcement on top of each other with the most present at the top\n",
    "\n",
    "### My example\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Author | Title | Body | Timestamp | Tags |\n",
    "| -- | ------ | ----- | ---- | --------- | ---- |\n",
    "|    |        |       |      |           |      |\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## My thoughts, why you should do this\n",
    "> My thoughts on the matter\n",
    "- The problem with fullstack development is no doubt the barrier entry in terms of knowledge that is needed\n",
    "- Knowing how to create API's with specific endpoints, or self generating javascript wireframes, it seems like an impossible tasks, much easier to do one or even none of what i listed\n",
    "- Through my experience in the Nighthawk CS route I found that most slackers in groups came from a place of self dismissal \"I can't do this\", \"Im never gonna understand this\"\n",
    "- My goal from these blog posts is to make this development as simple as can be, by taking you through these steps\n",
    "- Hopefully if you follow the steps of this notebook, you will be able to use this as a reference for the creation of your'e own features\n"
