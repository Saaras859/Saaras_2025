    "## How do API work?\n",
    "> Three main components\n",
    "1. Constructor.java (makes the data object), usually the name of feature + .java\n",
    "2. Controller file, how data in the table is received/changed through links \n",
    "3. JPA (Java Persistence API) file, for the creation of certain methods for the controller file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we use API's\n",
    "> These are the two main reason behind why we use them in this class\n",
    "1. Stores Data that is independent of the computer/frontend (Security, Ease of Accesses)\n",
    "2. Enables lazier coding (the data used from the API can be used to auto-generate HTML)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing API's using fetch\n",
    "> [Article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)\n",
    "- They are accessed by fetching a specific URL in the fetch() method\n",
    "- This method allows us to send list of headers with information we want the API to know\n",
    "    - GET, DELETE, POST, PUT (methods used in the controller file)\n",
    "    - Body (sending json data)\n",
    "    - CORS\n",
    "    - Cookies\n",
    "    - Content Type\n",
    "    - [The rest of them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) (still very important things to know)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Step 1\n",
    "> File Management\n",
    "- Create your features folder name in `src/main/java/com/nighthawk/spring_portfolio/mvc` (for me it is announcement)\n",
    "- Locate the announcement folder, copy and rename to what your feature name is\n",
    "- Copy and rename file to your feature, make sure to match the class name with the file name, change any other appearances of the former files name\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2\n",
    "> Constructor File\n",
    "- Change Announcement.java to your features name\n",
    "- Rename each instance of the word **Announcement** to your feature's name use ctrl+f\n",

    "### Step 2.1\n",
    "> Column Variables\n",

    "    - if you need to manipulate the array more you can\n",
