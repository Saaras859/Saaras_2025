    "Once payment is setup, you will be able to send your requests to the gpt api.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: It is important to hide your secret variables to prevent theft of keys. Do not commit the .env with all of the variables within directly to github, as your key will likely get stolen. There are many different solutions for hiding secrets, however the one I used was simply splitting each variable into 2 separate strings, then concatenating them when I needed those secret variables.\n",
