    "\n",
    "As we talked about earlier in the hashing section, hashing is a one-way function. This means that once you hash a value, you can't get the original value back. This is useful for storing passwords, but it also means that if two users have the same password, they will have the same hash. This is a problem because if an attacker gets access to the hash, they can use a rainbow table to look up the hash and find the original password.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we use Hasing with Salt which means that even if 2 users have the same password, they will have different hashes because we add a random value to the password before hashing it. This random value is called a salt."

    "### Homework Problem: Exploring Hashing and Privacy Protection (Extra Credit)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Problem:**\n",
    "Write a Java program that simulates how hashing works in protecting passwords. You will implement the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task 1: Basic Password Hashing**\n",
    "   - Write a program that accepts a user's password input and generates a hash using the **`hashCode()`** method.\n",
    "   - Display the original password and the hash to show how the same input always produces the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Task 2: Salting the Password**\n",
    "   - Enhance the program by generating a random **salt** for the password. Append the salt to the password before hashing, and display both the salt and the hashed password.\n",
    "   - Store the salt separately and demonstrate that the same password with a different salt produces a different hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Task 3: Verifying the Password**\n",
    "   - Write a method that simulates logging in by taking a password and salt as input, hashing them again, and comparing the result to the previously stored hash.\n",
    "   - If the hash matches, display \"Login Successful\"; otherwise, display \"Login Failed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Extra Challenge (Optional):**\n",
    "- Research and use the **`MessageDigest`** class in Java to implement password hashing with a more secure algorithm like **SHA-256**. Modify your program to use this instead of `hashCode()`.\n",
