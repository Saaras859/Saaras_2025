    "In Java, object-oriented programming allows developers to structure programs as a collection of classes and objects. One key concept in OOP is inheritance, where a class (subclass) inherits properties and methods from another class (superclass). This allows code to be reused and models relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Superclass:\n",
    "A superclass in Java is a general class that contains common fields and methods that can be shared by its subclasses. It is also sometimes referred to as a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Subclass:\n",
    "A subclass (or child class) is a class that extends the functionality of a superclass. A subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass and can also have its own additional properties and methods.\n"

    "## Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we wanted to solve the problem of managing different types of shapes, each with unique properties and behaviors, but still wanted to avoid repetitive code? Well, let's plan out a solution using inheritance.  By creating a general Shape class with shared attributes, and then extending it into specific subclasses like Rectangle and Triangle, we can reuse common logic while allowing each shape to override methods like calc_area() for their specific needs. This approach simplifies the design. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How are we setting this up?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about attributes that all shapes have. For simplicity, we can think of `name`, `length`, and `width` as attributes of a shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start setting up our main class. Here, we have a default and parametrized constructor. People can create a default shape, or pass in values to characterize their own shape.\n",
