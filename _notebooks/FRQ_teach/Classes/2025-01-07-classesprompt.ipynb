    "The **\"Classes\"** section gives a simple guide to handling Classes FRQs in APCSA. It explains key ideas like writing class headers, constructors, and methods, and keeping instance variables private. Following these steps makes your code organized and clear, which helps earn points on the exam.\n",

    "### Tips  \n",
    "1. **Follow Instructions**: Always match class headers, constructors, and method details to whatâ€™s asked in the question.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keep it Simple**: Use `this.variable = parameter;` to set instance variables in constructors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Scoping**: Class and method headers should usually be `public`, and instance variables should always be `private`.  \n"
