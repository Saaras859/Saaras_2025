    "These are ways to lose points. They apply to all kinds of FRQs, not just classes-related ones. Do not do these things!!\n",

    "## 1. Array/Collection Access Confusion (`[]` vs `get`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This penalty is applied when there is confusion between accessing elements in arrays and collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};\n",
    "System.out.println(arr[1]); // Correct for arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "list.add(10);\n",
    "System.out.println(list[0]); // Incorrect: should use list.get(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Extraneous Code That Causes Side Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This penalty is given for including unnecessary code that impacts the program's behavior, often unintentionally. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int addNumbers(int a, int b) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Adding numbers...\"); // Side-effect: unnecessary printing\n",
    "    return a + b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Local Variables Used but None Declared\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This penalty is for using local variables in a method or block without declaring them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int calculateSum() {\n",
    "    total += 5; // Incorrect: 'total' is used but not declared\n",
    "    int total = 0; // This declaration should come first\n",
    "    total += 5; // Correct\n",
    "    return total;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Destruction of Persistent Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This deduction is for modifying data in a way that unintentionally alters persistent values (like those referenced by parameters):\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void changeName(StringBuilder name) {\n",
    "    name.append(\" Smith\"); // Modifies the original object unintentionally\n",
    "}\n",
    "StringBuilder studentName = new StringBuilder(\"John\");\n",
    "changeName(studentName);\n",
    "System.out.println(studentName); // Output: \"John Smith\" (persistent data altered)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Void Method or Constructor That Returns a Value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This deduction is for attempting to return a value from a method or constructor declared void:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void printMessage() {\n",
    "    return \"Hello\"; // Incorrect: void methods cannot return a value\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    public MyClass() {\n",
    "        return; // Correct: constructors can return nothing implicitly\n",
    "    }\n",

    "1. Always start off with getting your easy points. You can get up to 4 points without understanding what the question is asking you at all. These points include declaring your class header, declaring private instance variables, \n",
    "2. Read the requirements carefully. For example, when the question stated that the `recordPlay` method does not return a value, this means that its method signature needs to be `public void`.\n",
    "3. **Use the table.** In classes related FRQs, there is no code given. You need to use what is expected based on the outputs of the table and explanations to write all the code yourself. I would highly recommend reading through everything before starting.\n",
    "4. Follow all instructions. Luckily the classes FRQ is generally the most straightforward out of all FRQs given during the test. From what I've seen so far, there are no real trick questions like the MCQ. You are graded on how well you followed the instructions given to you."
