/**
 * The GameControl object manages the game.
 * 
 * This code uses the JavaScript "object literal pattern" which is nice for centralizing control logic.
 * 
 * The object literal pattern is a simple way to create singleton objects in JavaScript.
 * It allows for easy grouping of related functions and properties, making the code more organized and readable.
 * In the context of GameControl, this pattern helps centralize the game's control logic, 
 * making it easier to manage game states, handle events, and maintain the overall flow of the game.
 * 
 * @type {Object}
 * @property {Player} player - The player object.
 * @property {function} start - Initialize game assets and start the game loop.
 * @property {function} gameLoop - The game loop.
 * @property {function} resize - Resize the canvas and player object when the window is resized.
